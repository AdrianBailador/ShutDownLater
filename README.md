# ShutDownLater

This is a simple console program created in C# that allows you to schedule your system to shut down in a certain number of minutes.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in your console.
2. You will see a nice banner and be asked to input a number (the amount of minutes until you want the system to shut down).
3. Input a positive integer and press Enter.
4. The program will display a countdown to the time you entered.
5. When the countdown ends, your system will shut down.

Note: Please be careful when using this program, as once the countdown is started, the system will shut down without any further warning or confirmation. Make sure to save any work you don't want to lose before running this program.
